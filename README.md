## Hello there! 🧔🏻

I'm Fyodor. I've been using 🐧GNU/Linux since 2012, but now, 10 years later, I managed to find time and opportunity to create software myself and contribute to other FLOSS projects. So here I am! 😊 I'm newbie in coding, so please expect my code to be shitty sometimes. But ofc I'm constantly learning 😀

**OS**: Fedora Silverblue 37
\
**DE**: GNOME
\
**PC specs**: AMD A6-6400K with integrated Radeon 8470D, 4Gb RAM, 120Gb SSD (yeah, potato computer, LOL)
\
I'm learning **Python** 🐍 and **C**\# 💜

### My apps
* **[Time Switch](https://github.com/fsobolev/timeswitch)** ⏲️ — power off, reboot, suspend, send a notification or execute any command on timer.
* **[Cavalier](https://github.com/fsobolev/cavalier)** 🎵 — audio visualizer based on CAVA.
